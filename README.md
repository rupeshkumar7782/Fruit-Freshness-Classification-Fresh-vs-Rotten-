 Fruit Freshness Classification (Fresh vs Rotten)
 Project Overview
This project classifies fruits as **Fresh** or **Rotten** using Machine Learning techniques.  
The model learns from image-based fruit data and predicts the freshness category of fruits.

 Objective
To build a classification system that helps identify fruit freshness automatically and can be used to reduce food waste and improve quality control.

 Technologies & Libraries Used
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- OpenCV  

 Machine Learning Approach
- Image preprocessing (resizing, normalization)
- Feature extraction
- Supervised classification model
- Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

 Dataset
- Image dataset containing fruit samples
- Two classes:
  - Fresh Fruits
  - Rotten Fruits
- Dataset is **not included** in this repository due to large file size

 Workflow
1. Importing required libraries  
2. Loading and preprocessing image data  
3. Label encoding (Fresh / Rotten)  
4. Splitting data into training and testing sets  
5. Model training  
6. Model evaluation and prediction
